# 1. Encrypt everything that is in a subdirectory.
#    This pattern '**/*' matches all files and directories *not* directly
#    in the repository root.
#    It does NOT encrypt files like 'README.md' or '.gitignore' if they are
#    in the root, which seems to be what you want.
**/* filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt

# 2. Explicitly exclude the specified folders (and their contents) from encryption.
#    The '!' negates the rule, meaning don't encrypt these.
#    The leading '/' makes the path relative to the root, preventing
#    e.g., 'nested/docs/file.txt' from being excluded if 'docs' was
#    only specified without the leading '/'.
